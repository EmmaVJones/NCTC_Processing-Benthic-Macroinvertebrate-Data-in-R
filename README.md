# NCTC_Processing-Benthic-Macroinvertebrate-Data-in-R
This repository holds data and scripts for the Processing Benthic Macroinvertebrate Data in R workshop given at NCTC on May 29, 2019. 

Description: An outline of the basics of building Rmarkdown reports for benthic datasets, showcasing the power of combining interactive analytical tools (Shiny) with automated reports (Rmarkdown) using probabilistic monitoring data to inform the benthic stressor analysis process in Virginia.


All scripts, data, and presentation slides for this workshop are available on this page. 

To follow along with the hands on portion of the workshop, please clone or download the project as a zip file. If you are new to git, the easiest way to get the data from the repository to your computer is to click the green 'Clone or download' button and unzip the file locally in a place that is easy to navigate back to.

You will need to have R and RStudio installed prior to the session. Please install R first if you have never installed either software before. R does not need administrative permissions to install. RStudio requires admin privleges, so please plan accordingly.

To install R version 3.6.0 : https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
Download and install accepting all defaults.

To install RStudio Version 1.2.1335 : https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download
Download and install accepting all defaults.

To install all packages necessary for the workshop (after R and RStudio are installed):
1) Navigate to the directory where you saved the unzipped github repository (NCTC_Processing-Benthic-Macroinvertebrate-Data-in-R-master).
2) Double click the file named NCTC_Processing-Benthic-Macroinvertebrate-Data-in-R.Rproj (this will open RStudio)
3) File -> Open File... and choose installPackages.R
4) Select all the rows press the 'Run' button in the top right of the screen (circled in blue in the picture below).
