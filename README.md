# NCTC_Processing-Benthic-Macroinvertebrate-Data-in-R
This repository holds data and scripts for the Processing Benthic Macroinvertebrate Data in R workshop given at NCTC on May 29, 2019. 

Description: An outline of the basics of building Rmarkdown reports for benthic datasets, showcasing the power of combining interactive analytical tools (Shiny) with automated reports (Rmarkdown) using probabilistic monitoring data to inform the benthic stressor analysis process in Virginia.


All scripts, data, and presentation slides for this workshop are available on this page.
